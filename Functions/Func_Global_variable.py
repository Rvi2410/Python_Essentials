"""
There's a special Python method which can extend a variable's scope in a way which includes the function's body
(even if you want not only to read the values, but also to modify them).

Such an effect is caused by a keyword named global:

Global Variable value can be modify/update from function by using "global" keyword
"""

# global <name of the variable> // after this keyword variable value will be impacted to the global variable
