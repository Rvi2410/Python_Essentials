1. List comprehension allows you to create new lists from existing ones in a concise and elegant way. The syntax of a list comprehension looks as follows:

[expression for element in list if conditional]

which is actually an equivalent of the following code:

for element in list:
    if conditional:
        expression

Here's an example of a list comprehension â€’ the code creates a five-element list filled with the first five natural numbers raised to the power of 3:

number = [num ** 3 for num in range(5)]
