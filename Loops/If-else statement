#   the indented statement(s) will be executed;
# if the true_or_not expression does not represent the truth (i.e., its value is equal to zero),
# the indented statement(s) will be omitted (ignored), and the next executed instruction will be the one after the original indentation level.

Nested if-else
Read what we have planned for this Sunday.
If the weather is fine, we'll go for a walk.
If we find a nice restaurant, we'll have lunch there. Otherwise, we'll eat a sandwich.
If the weather is poor, we'll go to the theater. If there are no tickets, we'll go shopping in the nearest mall.
