we have to introduce two important concepts: sequence types and mutability.

1) Sequence Types:
A sequence type is a type of data in Python which is able to store more than one value (or less than one, as a sequence may be empty),
and these values can be sequentially (hence the name) browsed

2) Mutability
i) Mutable:
=>Mutable data can be freely updated/modify at any time
ex.: List is mutable sequence data type

ii)Immutable
=> Immutable data cannot be modified in this way
ex: Tupple is immutable sequence data type

####################################################
Tupple:
=> Tuples prefer to use parenthesis (),
=> Whereas lists like to see brackets [],
=> Although it's also possible to create a tuple just from a set of values separated by commas.

tuple_1 = (1, 2, 4, 8)
tuple_2 = 1., .5, .25, .125

"""
The similarities may be misleading âˆ’ don't try to modify a tuple's contents! It's not a list!
