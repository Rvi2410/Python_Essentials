"""
Tupple:
=> Tuples prefer to use parenthesis () or without any brackets
=> Whereas lists like to see brackets [],
=> Although it's also possible to create a tuple just from a set of values separated by commas.

"""
The similarities may be misleading âˆ’ don't try to modify a tuple's contents! It's not a list!

Tupple can't be delete, modify, append, insert

"""
"""
What else can tuples do for you?

=> the 'len()' function accepts tuples, and returns the number of elements contained inside;
=> the '+' operator can join tuples together (we've shown you this already)
=> the '*' operator can multiply tuples, just like lists;
=> the 'in' and not in operators work in the same way as in lists.
